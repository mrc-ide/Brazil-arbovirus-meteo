# Brazil-arbovirus-meteo

This repository contains code to recreate the spatiotemporal regression modelling study in the paper 'Spatiotemporal relationships between extreme weather events and arbovirus transmission across Brazil'. 

## Code
All analyses can be run from the main.R file, which calls scripts with functions to run the analysis (contained in the R folder). 

## Data
You need to download the data separately from Zenodo and save in the data folder. Please cite both the paper and the data if including them in your work.
