# Arbovirus_Brazil_reg

This repository contains code to recreate the spatiotemporal regression modelling study in the paper 'Spatiotemporal relationships between extreme weather events and arbovirus transmission across Brazil' (https://doi.org/). The data is additionally contained at zenodo. 

## Code
All analyses can be run from the main.R file, which calls scripts with functions to run the analysis (contained in the R folder). 

## Data
You need to download the data separately from (zenodo) and save in the data folder. Please cite both the paper and the data when including them in your work.
